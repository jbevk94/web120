    <p>Piroshky Piroshky opened its doors for the very first time at Seattle’s famous Pike Place Market hoping to bring a taste of Russia to the Pacific Northwest. <br><br>
    Founded by the Kotelnikov family with just $1,200 to invest in the bakery. With the help of donations from friends and strangers, many of whom were immigrants of Russian descent, and a very basic business plan the bakery officially opened its doors on October 24, 1992.<br><br> Now owned by Olga Sagan, this family business is nationally renowned for its long lines out the door as guests eagerly anticipate savory and sweet Russian pastries, fresh from the oven. Beloved celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain even featured the bakery on his show “No Reservations.”</p>
    <br>
<p> Blending traditional recipes with local flavor, our selection of Piroshkies offer a wide array of choices, both savory and sweet. Traditionally served throughout markets and homes in Eastern Europe, often asked is <br> "What is a Piroshky?"<br> <br>The most simple answer is that they are hand held pies, and their fillings are as diverse and differing as the cultures and people who make and serve them. That is the beauty of Piroshky — everyone makes it a little differently, and recipes are passed down from generation to generation. From babushka to children.<br>

<br>
Here in our bakery at the Pike Place Market, starting two decades ago we decided to embrace and integrate the taste of the Northwest into our own traditional recipes. Our Piroshkies are individually made from scratch and hand-molded into their very own unique shapes — customers are delighted to find that this makes differentiating between them an easier task.<br>

<br>Though our bakery is small, our selection is anything but. We are always happy to offer suggestions and guide you in your selection. C'mon down, breath in the oven's aroma, and take a look at our freshly baked goods. It is not uncommon for Piroshkies to go straight from the oven and into your hands.</p>
<br>
<p>
The iconic Seattle-based bakery now boasts three brick-and-mortar locations and a food truck throughout the Seattle area. All piroshkies are hand formed and made from scratch in Seattle, for a great marriage of Russian heritage and local Seattle flavors.
