          their office. Someone in management. Age range of mid 20s to mid 50s.

          for their hard work. They don't want to waste time standing in a long
          line or waiting for their food to cook. They don't want to pay a bunch
          of money. They want something different than the go to bagel or
          donuts. Access the internet frequently from a desktop at their office.

          Tourists who are looking to try something different while they are on
          vacation. They've probably have no idea what a piroshky is. Roughly around mid 20s to late 30s. They have
          a good grasp on technology and mostly navigate websites on their
          phones. They are looking for Instagram worthy pictures of the new experiences they're having.

          </ul>
        </td>
        <td class = "approach">
          To appeal to tourists I recommend having a section that displays
          positive reviews because most people research a business before
          spending money. Also,beautiful pictures with descriptions of each
          piroshky. Additionally, I would highlight the location of the stores
          and the ease of access to popular tourists spots such as Pike Place
          Market and the Sky View Observatory.
