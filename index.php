 <p>I was born in Indiana and moved the pacific northwest when I was 18. Currently, I am studying programming at Seattle Central. Once complete I plan on working as a front end web developer. Additionally, I've also completed Front End Web and Mobile Development courses at Nucamp Bootcamp.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I work part time at a bakery where I make piroshky from scratch. I enjoy travelling and take at least four trips a year. I intend on visiting all 50 states and exploring at least three other continents, specifically Africa, Europe, and Austraila. I also enjoy DIY projects; I make my own cleaning and laundry products. I enjoy finding ways to decrease my waste and support living sustainably as often as I can.
